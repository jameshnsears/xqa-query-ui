enable xqa-shard's to be run, via a paramater, using container disk not RAM
= then they are queryable
= then update /home/jsears/GIT_REPOS/xqa-query-balancer/README.md
= maybe then I can just restart an old container and it remembers its data?

docker ps -a | grep xqa-shard
basexclient -U admin -P admin -p 32773
